Description: dummy package for termit
 There's no need for termit in a Ragnarok live iso,
 but it gets installed anyway. Can't find what package
 relies on it so this exists to prevent live-build
 from installing it. It can still be installed by the
 user later by first doing apt remove termit then
 apt install termit.
